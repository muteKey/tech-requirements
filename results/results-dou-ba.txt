About the project
The client is one of the most famous Swiss universities, traditionally featuring in various TOP-100 world universities rankings. Being an innovative institution, the university has gone through a digital transformation in recent years. We are working on the solution that combines features of the Research Information System and Campus Management Platform.
As a Research Information System, the solution allows to track the academic progress of the research fellows within the university. The system automatically generates personal reports for researchers based on a list of KPIs, such as number of the academic publications within a certain timeframe and department, number of the research grants obtained and amount of funds raised for each etc. Reports can be used for personal reasons as well as to make decisions about the academic promotion of the university staff. The Research Information System is currently used within the medical faculty, however, the expansion to other faculties is expected in the near future. As a Campus Management System, the solution can be useful in several ways: to generate professors’ and students’ personal schedules, assign rooms and track professors’ workload.
The project offers complex business challenges from the perspective of business logic and opportunities for growth and personal development.
