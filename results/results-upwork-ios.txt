Hello Guys,

I need 3 minor issues fixed on a native iOS app. Should hardly take a couple of hours max for the right person to understand and resolve the tasks.

1. It is only letting me input numbers for the postcode. We need both letter and number input (see screenshot attached).
2. I am also getting an error when inputting weight.
3. The gender field needs to be mandatory – so current users need to be notified if they have not completed it already
------------------------
I represent consumers who deal with Debt collection issues and want to develop an application that makes it easy for my client to track incoming Debt collector communications (calls/tets/emails/letters) my client receive; and then forward that captured collection effort as they occur to my CRM for review.

Develop a mobile application which can be used by my clients to:
- document incoming calls (from Debt collectors)
- maintain a database of collectors as more data is aggregated
- allow the client to take screen shots of incoming collection calls, letter, emails, and other evidence of collection communications received, which would then be synced with the compan'y CRM - Zoho (OR Zoho Creator)

The main data collected would be (and we need fields for this):
- Collector Name/Company 
- Phone number collector used
- date/time of collection attempt
- Collection representative my client spoke with (in the instance of a phone call)
- what was said by my client and the collector during the call, so I have a record of event with a good level of detail
- the ability to record the call ONLY AFTER THE COLLECTOR PROVIDES CONSENT.  Otherwise, recording without consent is illegal.
- Perhaps video content on the opening page with a tutorial on how to use the app

The App should be very basic.  Have an intro page with a video tutorial explaining how to use the app.  Include the above fields so when a new call comes in the consumer can select whether they think its a collection call, click a button and engage the app so the call can be recorded after some type of alert pops up for the consumer stating "you must request conest to record", capturing the incoming call or dialed call number to and from a collector.  Outbout calls would be made through the app or a button would ask the consumer if the outbound call is to a debt collector they want to document the call with; and the basic information/fields above.

------------------------
The design will be similar to the default ios keyboard with some extra added features. Prior experience in designing a keyboard app isn't necessary, but it'll be advantageous for you.

Building a fitness website and app that may have a long duration to complete but will be done a little bit at a time as budget allows. We can chat about how many hours the first step will take so I have the budget set aside, and we can go from there. 

Step 1)  A landing page
Step 2) It will need a place for members to create a login, and profile, with a responsive survey/questionnaire. I will then need to be able to put the member into a group. 
Step 3) Ability to upload program templates for members to follow and input their own activity. 
Step 4) Space for videos to be uploaded and linked to exercises that users can watch 
Step 5) A notification system so I can send messages to users and set up reminders for appointments

There will then be many more steps as we expand into new forms of training.

Our company has built the application, and now we need certificates to publish it。

This is a simple job to build an iPhone application that monitors the phone and sms messages (inbound and outbound) then logs those messages each minute to a sftp site.

I am seeking a developer to create a casino game for both the iPhone and Android stores. I have a majority of the designs already finished, and in .PSD (Photoshop) and .JPG format. So far, the game was intended to be a Slots Game. I am looking for a programmer with reputable, published works on either Google Play or the iPhone App store. 

Also, I am requiring a video interview before I accept the work for hire. Please let me know. Thank you.
------------------------
The graphics and animations will be professional grade quality, so this would be an excellent portfolio piece after it is published.  Note:  I have intentially set the budget at "$5" on Upwork because I want an evaluation of the project to be conducted, and then given a time estimation to determine the total cost.  A very thorough and detailed outline explaining details of the functionality will be provided to help you determine this.

The developer(s) or company will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before conducting a presentation of the project.

A team of developers have created an existing mobile game application.  It was developed in Unity with Doozy UI.  I have hired two different teams to work on this, and yet the simulation results logic still doesn't appear to be correct. Currently, the application is combined into two parts:  blackjack game and card counting simulator.  Due to the large size of the application, I will be requesting that the existing application be separated into two different applications.  We will be focusing on completing the Blackjack game first.  A lot of the logic has been completed, however it does need to be finished.  The UI has been done using Doozy UI.  It will need to be reworked with new graphics.  A lot of the functionality still needs to be reworked or finished, too.  If need be, we may need to transfer the code into an entirely new project.  I don't want to start the project from square one, but perhaps existing code/functionality can be referenced to avoid reinventing the wheel.  You would have to look at the project code to evaluate it to determine the best direction.

Animations and graphics have been completed that need to be applied to the current application.  You would need to walk through the details and functionality of the application, and verify an accurate billable time estimation (this would be done through a screen share / phone call presentation).  Also, the current Unity project files would be shared with you to review the code, and to become familiar with it to see what modifications and additions need to be applied.

The developer or team would also be responsible for publishing the game on both the Apple Store and Google Play.

The animations and instructions on the functionality are well organized and described on a Slack site.  Folder and file structures would also be well organized.

I have an AnyDesk license that would be used to conduct screen-share sessions between myself and the developers.  I would want to use Signal to conduct phone calls while screen sharing.  I require full access to the developer and/or team because I will be working closely with the developer(s) to provide the animations and graphics.  I would expect to communicate with the developer(s) during development while working closely with me, daily, along with a daily status update of the progress of the project - A SET DAILY WORK SCHEDULE THAT IS A NORMAL BUSINESS WORK WEEK, 6 - 8 HOURS PER DAY.

Eventually, I will need to hire a developer, long term, to provide ongoing upgrades and support, after the game is published.   The published game will require maintenance and support.  This support and maintenance would include a permanent, ongoing fee paid on a consistent basis.  After this contract is completed, we would discuss this ongoing assignment.
