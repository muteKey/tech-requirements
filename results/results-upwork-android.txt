Introduction

app
, starting from scratch. Must be available on both
App
Store and Play store. React Native or no-code tools are recommended, and may be discussed.

app
The goal of this new application is to provide an interface to be able to make an order by using the Lockers. A customer should be able to see the available lockers, select a locker, validate the order, login (or register) and pay the order

We have a ReactNative
app
where the main functionality lies with a draggable list which incudes a left/right swipe functionality as well. We have used react-native-draggable-flatlist and react-native-swipeable-item to implement the functionality. Unfortunately, we get a lot of complaints that the scroll and drag functionality are slow and  broken (especially on
Android
). User Experience suffers.

We are looking for someone who is well experienced with implementing similar functionality with RN and can fix and optimise our list implementation. We are also open to a complete re-write of the functionality as well as implementing it natively and bridging to it from RN.

We will naturally share with you the
app
details and if needed source code. We can also work with you to define the new interface for the component. 

The success of this project lies with providing our users with a excellent smooth experience!

Looking forward to working with you. Hopefully, we can continue to work on more projects.
------------------------
We have a small web application (health and well-being related) for which we need a set of automatic "black-box" tests. The
app
itself is developed in React Native with iOS as the main target platform.
Android
is also supported, but is less important. The tests shall be automated using Selenium or a similar framework and run through basic application functionality. If your skills permit, also automated verification of the REST API endpoints can be developed. You will have access to the application and to the API documentation.

Hello! I am a serial e-commerce entrepreneur and am looking for a
developer
, or team of
developers
, to assist me with my next project and product(s). 

Here is an example of a similar product and web application I want to build: https://buy.linqapp.com/collections/all-1/products/linq-card-1. Watch the video here to understand. 

It is a business card that has a QR Code on it and NFC chip. When someone scans the QR Code, it takes them to a one page site that has the business card owners information (email, phone, etc.). 

I need help in building the web portal and database for the business card owner to input their information when they get the card, which is then shown on a one page site. 

Here is how the process works: 
1. Customer places order for business card. 
2. Customer receives the business card in the mail. They also receive a piece of paper that has a pin on it, which is linked to their unique QR code. They scan the QR code and input the pin. 
3. This then takes them to a portal where they can input their information (name,email, etc.). Once they do that, they hit 'submit' and save their profile. That information is now processed and put onto a single page website, which is shown when you scan the custom QR code. When you reach out to me, please include the word digital. 

I want to recreate a system exactly like this. 

This is NOT
development
for a e-commerce website - that is being handled separately by another team - this is just the backend system and database. 


Also, this is NOT a iOS or
android
interface. It is a web
app
. Here is a figma design file of the flow: https://www.figma.com/file/Uey3SDca1DnzzazsSftctx/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

I am open to using whitelisted solutions.

- UX/UI, Angular, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, Query, Bootstrap, Angular.js, React.js, and Vue.js.
