About project:
Customer sees itself as a personalized subscription service that utilizes continuous health information combined with human and machine intelligence to take care of its members daily. It has developed clinical-grade wearables capable of transmitting user health data to the cloud. From there, an artificial intelligence engine processes the data and resurfaces it to the user in a personalized app, while another copy of the data is sent to live healthcare providers for review and a potential intervention handled within the service.
Partner will build a system that ingests Electronic Health Record (‚ÄúEHR‚Äù) system data from various providers. EHR data is historically poorly formatted, and client will ensure that all incoming data is correctly formatted, mapped, and ready to use. This allows company to unlock EHR data and integrate it with data sources to provide a full picture of the provider‚Äôs data while ensuring security and respecting patient privacy. As Senior iOS Developer, they will be a part of a large-scale mobile app development team leading iOS related mobile application development throughout all phases of the software development life cycle.
