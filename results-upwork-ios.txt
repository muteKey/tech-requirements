We have a ReactNativeappwhere the main functionality lies with a draggable list which incudes a left/right swipe functionality as well. We have used react-native-draggable-flatlist and react-native-swipeable-item to implement the functionality. Unfortunately, we get a lot of complaints that the scroll and drag functionality are slow and  broken (especially on Android). User Experience suffers.

We are looking for someone who is well experienced with implementing similar functionality with RN and can fix and optimise our list implementation. We are also open to a complete re-write of the functionality as well as implementing it natively and bridging to it from RN.

We will naturally share with you theappdetails and if needed source code. We can also work with you to define the new interface for the component. 

The success of this project lies with providing our users with a excellent smooth experience!

Looking forward to working with you. Hopefully, we can continue to work on more projects.

What we're looking for:

We are looking for a backend expert to close out some remaining features for our MVP. Mainly adjustments to existing endpoints and a few new endpoints. Once those features are closed out, we have a few epics we need to complete before we are ready for V1 (ie: AWS Cloud, notification service, 

Product Overview:

A new grid/browse-based datingappwhere the user controls the search experience. Theappoperates like LinkedIn or Airbnb - users can filter on various criteria and sort the results to find exactly what they are looking for. The goal is to create a more efficient way to find and connect with people you're interested in dating.

Existing Backend Stack
We are looking for someone to help us close out some remaining features for our MVP. Our existing stack is as follows
- Node server w/ TS
- Prisma Cloud
- AWS EC2 Instance
- MySQL
- Elastic Beanstalk
- Not yet implemented: AWS Cloudfront to improve image fetching performance

State of the project:

We have aniOS(Swift)appthat is currently ahead of our Backend. So we must finish about 10-15 tasks (varying in LOE).
- We need someone to come in to wrap up a few Endpoints that have been started but not yet completed (Feel free to rewrite these if it's easier). Tasks range from adding pagination to a few endpoints, to writing a script to seed our MySQL test database with 2 CSV files of mock data, to creating new endpoints to do things like fetching user likes.
- Next, we need to focus on optimizing Images within theapp. We want to use AWS Cloudfront for this, but I am open to alternatives if the juice is worth the squeeze.
- Build out a notification service in AWS
- Optional (I'm happy to do this if it's outside your wheelhouse) -- setup AWS Lambda functions for a few Functions our Data Science team has built out
